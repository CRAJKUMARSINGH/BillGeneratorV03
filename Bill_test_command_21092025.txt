Stepwise Instructions for Testing and Enhancing Bill Generator Apps

Target Apps

C:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV01

C:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV02

C:\Users\Rajkumar\BillGeneratorV03

Run All Bill Apps

Execute each bill app and report its current status (success/failure, errors, warnings).

Use Input Files for Testing

Input source folders: test_input_* or sample_input*

Run all input files, either one by one or as a batch, in the relevant app.

Ensure all input files are processed.

Output Management

Save outputs in an Output folder.

Create subfolders for each run named as serial_number + date for organized storage.

Template Testing and Readability Enhancements

Test all templates:

Deviation statement

Final bill scrutiny

Extra items

Certificate templates

Check vertical alignment and readability for all templates.

First page and deviation row height should auto-fit to the text length.

Conditional Formatting Rules

If there are no extra items, templates should:

Not leave blank rows on the first page, deviation section, or extra items section.

Populate properly without gaps.

Column Population Fix

Ensure all columns of deviation are populated correctly.

Consistency Across Apps

Apply the same readability and formatting standards consistently in:

BillGeneratorV01

BillGeneratorV02

BillGeneratorV03

Table Width Specifications

⚠️ Important: All table widths were specified after hundreds of tests.

Do not modify widths arbitrarily.

If any changes were made, revert them immediately and restore the original widths, maintaining the mutual ratios established.
