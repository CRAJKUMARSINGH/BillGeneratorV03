### Stepwise Instructions

1. **Audit the Application**

   * Go through the application carefully.
   * Check all **dependencies**, **build commands**, and **run commands**.
   * Prepare a **list of everything needed** to run the app locally on your computer.
   * ⚠️ **Do not make any changes** to the code at this stage.

2. **Document Local Setup**

   * Create a `RUN_LOCALLY.md` file.
   * Include all the info from step 1: dependencies, build instructions, and run instructions.
   * ⚠️ Only create this file; do not modify any other part of the app.

3. **Environment Setup**

   * Create a `.env` file.
   * Include required environment variables (e.g., session secret, database URL).
   * Example:

     ```env
     SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     ```

4. **Git Ignore Sensitive Files**

   * Create a `.gitignore` file.
   * Ensure it **includes `.env`** so secrets are not pushed to GitHub.
   * ⚠️ Do not make other changes to the project.

5. **Build and Run the Application**

   * Once the `.env` is ready with `SESSION_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL`, build and run the application locally.
   * Ensure it runs successfully without errors.

6. **Programmatic Input / Test Files**

   * Run the program using **input files** from the relevant folder if they exist.
   * If no input files are present, **draft sample files** (e.g., `*.xls`, `*.csv`, `*.txt`) as needed by the application to test functionality.
