# üß™ **App Testing Prompt**

## **Purpose**

To comprehensively **test the app** in two distinct modes:
A. **Excel File Upload Mode**
B. **Online Mode**

---

## **üìÇ Data Storage Requirements**

### **Folders and Structure**

1. All **input Excel files** must be stored in the folder:

   ```
   INPUT_FILES/
   ```
2. All **output files** (results, logs, reports, etc.) must be stored in:

   ```
   OUTPUT_FILES/
   ```
3. Inside the `OUTPUT_FILES` directory, create **sub-folders** for each test run using the following naming rule:

   ```
   OUTPUT_FILES/YYYY-MM-DD/
   ```

   * Example: `OUTPUT_FILES/2025-10-14/`
4. If a test is repeated on the same date, append the **time** to ensure uniqueness:

   ```
   OUTPUT_FILES/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/
   ```

   * Example: `OUTPUT_FILES/2025-10-14_10-45-32/`
5. Each output subfolder should contain:

   * Processed Excel files
   * Validation summaries
   * Error or log reports
   * Comparison results (for Online vs Upload Mode)

---

## **A. Excel File Upload Mode**

### **Objective**

Test the app‚Äôs ability to handle **bulk data imports** from multiple Excel files.

### **Instructions**

1. Use **all sheets** from **all input files** available in:

   ```
   test_input_files/
   ```
2. Additionally, use **25 more input files** created or generated by your system (‚Äúby your sweet will‚Äù).
3. Ensure that:

   * Every sheet is correctly read and processed.
   * Merged data and parsing logic function correctly.
   * Validation results and logs are properly generated.
   * The app successfully saves outputs in the designated `OUTPUT_FILES` subfolder with the proper date‚Äìtime name.

## **B. Online Mode**

### **Objective**

Test the app‚Äôs **interactive data entry and processing** system in live (online) mode.

### **Instructions**

1. Use **only the Work Order parts** of the files referenced in Mode A.
2. Fill in **approximately 60‚Äì75%** of items **manually online**.
3. Assign **quantities** within **10‚Äì125%** of the original Work Order quantities.
4. Add **1‚Äì10 extra items** (not present in the input files) using your discretion.
5. Verify that:

   * Validation, calculation, and data binding work correctly.
   * Submissions and output exports are accurate.
   * Data is stored properly in the corresponding `OUTPUT_FILES` subfolder.
   * Comparison reports (between online and uploaded modes) are saved automatically.

## ‚úÖ **Expected Outputs**

* Detailed processing logs
* Validation and error reports
* Comparison summaries (Upload vs Online data)
* Performance and accuracy metrics
* Organized output folders for easy retrieval
