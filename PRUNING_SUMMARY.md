2. BILL_SCRUTINY_SHEET_FINAL_CONFIRMATION.md
3. BILL_SCRUTINY_SHEET_IMPLEMENTATION.md
4. BLANK_RATE_HANDLING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
5. BLANK_RATE_MODIFICATIONS_SUMMARY.md
6. CODE_REVIEW_AND_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
7. DEVIATION_STATEMENT_DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION.md
8. EXTRA_ITEMS_DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION.md
9. FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
10. FIRST_PAGE_DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION.md
11. FIXED_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md

## Files Preserved
All critical files were preserved to maintain functionality and documentation:

### Core Documentation
- README.md - Main project overview
- COMPLETE_COMBINED_DOCUMENTATION.md - Comprehensive documentation containing all information from removed files
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies

### Application Files
- All HTML templates in the `templates/` directory
- All Python source files in the `src/` directory
- Streamlit application files
- Test files and utilities

## Validation
- All preserved files were verified to exist after pruning
- Backup copies of removed files are stored in `backup_md_files/` directory
- No functionality was lost as all information from removed files is contained in COMPLETE_COMBINED_DOCUMENTATION.md

## Benefits
- Reduced project clutter by 17 files
- Simplified documentation structure
- Maintained all critical information and functionality
- Preserved computational logic and statutory compliance
- Created cleaner repository for future development

## Process Summary
The pruning was performed using a safe, automated process that:
1. Identified redundant files based on naming patterns
2. Created backups of all files to be removed
3. Automatically removed the redundant files
4. Verified that critical files were still present
5. Generated detailed logs of all actions
