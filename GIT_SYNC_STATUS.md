# Git Synchronization Status

## Current Status
The repository has all files staged for commit but is unable to complete the commit process due to what appears to be a Git configuration or terminal environment issue.

## Files Staged for Commit
All project files are currently staged including:
- Source code files
- HTML templates
- Documentation files
- Test files
- Output files
- Configuration files

## Remote Repository
The remote repository is configured at:
https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/BillGeneratorV03.git

## Next Steps
1. Once Git commit issue is resolved, commit all staged files
2. Push to remote repository
3. Verify synchronization is complete

## Manual Resolution
If automatic Git operations continue to fail:
1. Manually commit using a different Git client
2. Use GitHub Desktop or similar tool
3. Clone repository to a different location and transfer files
